info:
  description: "This is the API reference of The Spoon project.\n IMPORTANT: The version number works in this way: it's composed of two numbers separated by a point. The first number identifies the Sprint, so for example the version 2.1 of the API reference is related to the Sprint number 2. The second number starts from 0 and has to be increased by one each time the file is modified. The person who modifies this document is responsible for increasing the number."
